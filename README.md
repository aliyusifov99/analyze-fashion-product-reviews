# Fashion Product Reviews Analysis üõçÔ∏è

## Overview

This project is centered around analyzing fashion product reviews to predict ratings and recommendations. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the project delves into the nuances of customer feedback to derive meaningful insights.

## Inspiration üí°

The motivation behind this project is to harness the power of natural language processing and deep learning to understand customer sentiments in fashion reviews. By analyzing these reviews, we aim to predict product ratings and recommendations, providing valuable insights for both consumers and retailers in the fashion industry.

## Features üåü

- **Rating Prediction**: Uses deep learning models to predict the ratings of fashion products based on customer reviews.
- **Recommendation Prediction**: Analyzes the text of reviews to predict whether a product is recommended by the reviewer.

## Installation üîß

Clone the project using: `git clone git@github.com:aliyusifov99/analyze-fashion-product-reviews.git`


## Usage üöÄ

The analysis involves processing the review text and using trained models to predict ratings and recommendations. The project includes notebooks that detail each step of the process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Technical Details üîç

### Data Analysis and Preparation

The initial phase of the project involves a comprehensive analysis of the training dataset, preparing it for deep learning models.

### Model Development

The project employs deep learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Bag of Words techniques, to analyze and predict ratings and recommendations from fashion product reviews.
